# Chapter 1: Fractals
Broadly speaking, a **fractal** is a self-similar and never-ending geometric pattern
that repeats itself at different scales. Essentially, you can zoom in at any point on 
a fractal and find the same repeating shapes forever.

Despite the complexity of their overall structure, they are most often generated by repeating simple iterative or recursive
processes. A fractal is merely the culmination of an endless repetition of the same action.

Heuristically, if fractals are to be summarized in one sentence, they should be thought of as objects
composed of smaller copies of themselves.

## Sierpiński Triangle
**Geometric fractals** are the simplest to illustrate and can be made by repeating any basic geometric process
an infinite number of times. The most famous example of this is likely the **Sierpiński Triangle** whose formulation
follows a standard sequence of deletions.

**1)** Start with any equilateral triangle.

**2)** Divide this triangle into 4 other equilateral triangles, and remove the middle one.
The remaining 3 triangles will have side lengths equal to half the side length of
the original triangle.

**3)** Repeat step 2 on the remaining triangles indefinitely.

## The Mandelbrot Set
Another class of fractals are **algebraic fractals** which are created by repeatedly calculating
the same equation over and over. Technically speaking, the first few iterations of a geometric fractal (these are created with a process of iteration)
can be drawn by hand. Since algebraic fractals require calculating an equations thousands or millions
of times, they are strictly explored with computers.

Algebraic fractals are more formally obtained through a recurrence function in
the complex plane. Given a function 
$$f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$$
