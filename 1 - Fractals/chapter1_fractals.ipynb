    "Broadly speaking, a **fractal** is a self-similar and never-ending geometric pattern\n",
    "that repeats itself at different scales. Essentially, you can zoom in at any point on \n",
    "a fractal and find the same repeating shapes forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that technically speaking, fractals are not \n",
    "required to be *perfectly* self-similar. Fractal geometry deals more with the extension of dimensions to all positive real numbers (not just \n",
    "whole numbers) than it does with self-similarity. For instance, the Sierpiński triangle discussed below\n",
    "is approximately 1.585-dimensional. However, for the sake of aesthetic exploration and our future chapters, we \n",
    "will almost exclusively be referring to self-similar fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the complexity of their overall structure, they are most often generated by repeating simple iterative or recursive processes. A fractal is merely the culmination of an endless repetition of the same action.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Geometric fractals** are the simplest to illustrate and can be made by repeating any basic geometric process\n",
    "an infinite number of times. The most famous example of this is likely the **Sierpiński Triangle** whose formulation\n",
    "follows a standard sequence of deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Start with any filled in equilateral triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Divide this triangle into 4 other equilateral triangles, and remove the middle one.\n",

    "from its intrinsic beauty and the elegance of its construction, it possesses fascinating mathematical properties. It is an extension of the Koch curve, a 1904 example of a continuous curve, constructible with elementary geometry but for which\n",

    "$n$ iterations is $S_n=3\\cdot 4^n$. Assuming the original equilateral triangle has side lengths of size $l$, the second \n",
    "iteration will have side lengths of size $\\frac{l}{3}$, the third of size $\\left(\\frac{l}{3}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{l}{3^3}$, and so on. The $n$th iteration of the construction is a snowflake with $S_n=3\\cdot 4^n$ sides, each of length $P_n=\\frac{l}{3^{n-1}}$. As such, the perimeter of the $n$th iteration is $S_n\\cdot P_n$, so that the length of the Koch snowflake equals\n",

    "can be drawn by hand. Since algebraic fractals require calculating an equation thousands or millions\n",
    "of times, they are strictly explored with computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebraic fractals are more formally obtained through a recurrence function in\n",
    "the complex plane. Generally, we apply a function $f:\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ iteratively to each point\n",
    "$z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}$. We thus obtain a sequence $\\{z_0, f(z_0), f(f(z_0)), ...\\}$ of complex numbers for \n",
    "each $z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}$. Whether a point $z_0$ is coloured (included in the fractal) depends on whether\n",
    "the modulus of its corresponding sequence diverges to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to a binary colouring based on divergence sis to colour a point $z_0$ depending on the time\n",
    "it takes its corresponding sequence to reach a certain threshold. This allows us to scale the colouring of points in the complex plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Mandelbrot Set\n",
    "To construct the binary (black and white) Mandelbrot Set fractal, we start with a point $z_0$ in the complex plane and consider the recurrence equation\n",
    "$$ z_{n+1} = z_n^2+z_0 $$\n",
    "to obtain the sequence of complex numbers $\\{z_0, z_1, z_2, ...\\}$. We define the Mandelbrot Set $M$ to be the set of $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$\n",
    "whose corresponding sequence of moduli do not diverge to infinity. We can then paint the complex plane by setting all points in $M$ to be black and all other points to be white.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, to make this a computable endeavour, we must make a few simplifications. First off, it can be proven that given any $z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}$, if for some $n$, $|z_n|>2$, then the sequence $z_n, z_{n+1}, ...$ will necessarily go off to $\\infty$. We must then \n",
    "pick some maximum number $N$ to check whether $|z_N|>2$. Unfortunately, using any finite number $N$ will introduce some degree of error\n",
    "in our plot but the larger we choose $N$ to be, the better our fractal will represent the formal set $M$. For our simulation (binary_mandelbrot.py), we will use $N=150$ as a default. Our next consideration is the fact that we are dealing with finite resolution. While we can work with all numbers in the complex plane, we of course will only consider the portion\n",
    "which corresponds to the window in which we will render the fractal. For each pixel in our frame, we will take a representative $z_0$ to be the center of the pixel. A $100x100$ pixel frame would thus require testing $100^2=10,000$ pixels.\n",

    "To generate the standard version of the mandelbrot set, we need only slightly modify our approach\n",
    "to the binary edition. As before, any point $z_0\\in M$ will be painted a fixed colour. Instead of colouring\n",
    "each of the points whose sequence escapes to infinity a second fixed colour, we paint them based on a basic \"escape time\"\n",
    "algorithm. Given a point $z_0\\notin M$ and its corresponding sequence $\\{z_0, z_1, z_2, ...\\}$,\n",
    "we consider the number of iterations required for $z_n$ to reach a magnitude greater than $2$ (i.e. its escape time). We can map the number of iterations before $|z_n|>2$ to a colour gradient which ranges\n",
